## üîß **How It Works**

### **Staking by Users**

Users deposit stablecoins (backed by USDe) on the InflaStop platform. The funds are invested to generate sustainable yield.

### **Yield Distribution**

The yield generated is distributed proportionally:

- **80% to Users**: Returns to borrowers and stakers.
- **20% to Platform**: Covers operational costs.

### **Interest-Free Loans**

Users can borrow stablecoins without interest. Repayment is deducted automatically from generated yield.

### **Real-Time Governance and Transparency**

Users can monitor transactions, yield generation, and fund utilization via an on-chain governance dashboard.
